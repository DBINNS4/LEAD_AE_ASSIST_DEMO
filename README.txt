Lead AE Assist – Static UI Prototype

This is a stripped-down, front-end-only demo of the LEAD AE Assist app.

• No backend, no Adobe/Electron integration
• Sidebar tabs switch between panels visually
• Checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown inputs show hover/active/checked states
• Text is pre-filled using the English locale from the original app

To use:
1. Extract this zip somewhere on your machine.
2. Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc).
3. Click around the sidebar, toggles, and fields – nothing will touch your real system.
